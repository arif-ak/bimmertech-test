#                                                    This kit adds compatibility with our smartphone mirroring, content streaming and park assist retrofits, otherwise unavailable to owners of older vehicles."
#                                description: "Our HD Screen in a drop-in replacement for the smaller 6 screen found in pre-2009 E60/E61/E63/E64 and E90/E91/E92/E93 BMWs with a CCC or M‑ASK head unit. This larger 8.8, 1280×480 screen matches those found in many of the latest BMWs, and is carefully designed to fit your dashboard perfectly.
#                                              The larger screen is ideal for multimedia consumption or for use with a park assist camera, when the smaller screen can be difficult to see. For greater visibility in direct sunlight, the screen does not feature the plastic shield found in front of older factory iDrive displays.
#                                              To extend the capabilities of your iDrive, this screen also includes our HD interface, adding compatibility with our range of optional accessories. Add iOS and Android smartphone mirroring or stream Apple TV 3 apps for a greater multimedia experience, or take advantage of all the features of our reverse camera, including dynamic on-screen parking lines.
#                                              HD Screen will be connected to your iDrive through the standard video port and the display will automatically be optimized for the larger screen, maintaining the full functionality of your factory display."

#                                                    This kit adds compatibility with our smartphone mirroring, content streaming and park assist retrofits, otherwise unavailable to owners of older vehicles."
#                                description: "Our HD Screen in a drop-in replacement for the smaller 6 screen found in pre-2009 E60/E61/E63/E64 and E90/E91/E92/E93 BMWs with a CCC or M‑ASK head unit. This larger 8.8, 1280×480 screen matches those found in many of the latest BMWs, and is carefully designed to fit your dashboard perfectly.
#                                              The larger screen is ideal for multimedia consumption or for use with a park assist camera, when the smaller screen can be difficult to see. For greater visibility in direct sunlight, the screen does not feature the plastic shield found in front of older factory iDrive displays.
#                                              To extend the capabilities of your iDrive, this screen also includes our HD interface, adding compatibility with our range of optional accessories. Add iOS and Android smartphone mirroring or stream Apple TV 3 apps for a greater multimedia experience, or take advantage of all the features of our reverse camera, including dynamic on-screen parking lines.
#                                              HD Screen will be connected to your iDrive through the standard video port and the display will automatically be optimized for the larger screen, maintaining the full functionality of your factory display."

##                                title: 'Patent images of the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe Surface Online'
##                                image: '/fixture_images/article/article1.jpg'
##                                content: 'BMW last week finally gave us an official view of the upcoming 8 Series. The return of the model after 20 years is a significant step for the Bavarian manufacturer, which will now have a weapon to take on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi S8 and Porsche Panamera.
##                                          However, only the coupe version had been confirmed... until now. We now have the first images providing a glimpse of the four-door Gran Coupe variant of the model. As recently happened with the BMW Z4, the leaked sketches are patent images, destined for the patent office from the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property.
##                                          Looks increasingly like there’s a regular inside spy somewhere...
##                                          This is not the first clue BMW watchers have gotten regarding what a four-door version of the 8 Series might look like. Earlier this year, BMW presented the M8 Gran Coupe as a concept at the Geneva auto show. The leaked images we’re seeing this week confirm that the automaker did not intend to lose time at the concept stage for long.
##                                          One surprising fact about the new 8 Series is that it’s actually shorter than the 5 Series, by about 5 cm. it’s also shorter than the 7 Series, by about 35 cm. Clearly, the model that arrives at dealerships in the near-future won’t be an oversized monster. We expect that the production model will most closely resemble the company’s 6 Series.
##                                          Mechanically, the Gran Coupe will be powered by the same 4.4L twin-turbo V8 found in the coupe. With 523 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque, the car will be well-equipped to rival its powerful competitors. Spy images are also floating around online of an M8 coupe variant being tested in camouflage. In its case, the same engine will deliver at least 617 hp, the same as the M5, with the distinct possibility that it will go beyond that output.
##                                          The images leaked from the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property include one of a cabriolet version as well.'

##                                image: '/fixture_images/article/article2.jpg'
##                                content: '20 years after the 8 Series disappeared, the BMW catalogue will once again feature the line, and soon. BMW has released official images of the reborn coupe.
##                                            The images reveal much about the new product, of course, but also lifts the veil on the new design signature the Bavarian automaker is planning to gradually introduce across its product range. The defining elements of this new look include an elongated silhouette and pillars that are thinner than the norm today. The rear lights are much more stretched and slender than before, which represents a departure for the brand.
##                                            This is undoubtedly good news – respect for tradition is great and all, but it is possible to evolve within that!
##                                            Speaking of tradition, the new 8 Series, like its predecessor, features a stretched wheelbase as well as a wider-than-average tread.'

##                                content: 'BMW made public more details regarding the power output of its upcoming M850i, set to make its debut this summer. Owners of the reborn 8 Series will, it’s clear, will have their hands full. The 4.4L turbo engine, which BMW says has been entirely revised, produces 530 hp and an astronomical 553 lb-ft of torque.
##                                          The spectacular new car, which will get its official reveal on Friday, June 15 on the eve of the 24 Hours of Le Mans will be the first of the 8 Series models that the company is bringing back after a 20-year absence. This two-door coupe will be followed a convertible and a sedan. There is also talk of a possible 700-hp M8 further down the road.
##                                          To start with, though, just the coupe will be available to consumers, as an xDrive. The powertrain will however prioritize the rear wheels. The engine will run in conjunction with an 8-speed automatic transmission, the only gearbox to be offered.'
