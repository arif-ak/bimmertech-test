With our Rear View Camera (OEM), you get the same park assist upgrade that BMW offers and installs at the factory.

                                                      Due to the OEM origin, the kit perfectly integrates into the bodywork of your car as well as your iDrive system. What&#39;s more, this BMW backup camera produces the highest picture quality on the market. But these are not the only features that make it stand out.

                                                      Our Rear View Camera (OEM) is the only park assist retrofit compatible with Surround View, that provides 360 degree visibility, and Trailer Hitch mode. The latter makes it possible to change the angle of the camera and see the trailer hitch while backing up.

                                                      In addition, the wide-angle lens shows you a detailed, full-color and perspective-corrected view of every obstacle behind your car, making parking safe and easy.

                                                      To take advantage of all this kit&#39;s features, your vehicle must be equipped with the Park Distance Control system (PDC) and iDrive with Navigation Professional.</pre>'

All you need to do is swap your stock display for BimmerTech&rsquo;s VividScreen &mdash; a BMW display upgrade that lets you add the latest technology upgrades to your car and realize its potential.</p>

                                                      <p>The new 8.8&rdquo; 1280x480 display doubles or triples the pixel density of the stock screen options, as well as sporting noticeably improved contrast for a better overall image quality. It&rsquo;s completely compatible with the BMW iDrive system and designed to look the same as a factory installed screen to smoothly fit into your interior.</p>

                                                      <p>With this BMW screen upgrade your car becomes compatible with SmartView mirroring functionality. It means that you can choose among SmartView Apple TV3 and SmartView Apple TV4, both of which will let you stream the screen of your iOS device onto the dashboard display. You can also opt for SmartView HD Flex that makes it possible to mirror the Android as well as iOS devices onto the BMW native screen. Thanks to the inbuilt Multimedia Interface (MMI), you can also add our rear &amp; front view cameras and the above mentioned streaming devices for a much lower price.</p>

                                                      <p>VividScreen is designed for 3-series F30/31/34 and 4-series F32/33/36 models fitted with an older generation CHAMP2, ENTRY or ENTRYNAV iDrive system, featuring a 6&rdquo; 480x240 display. The image on the replacement screen will be slightly stretched. However, for vehicles with the ENTRYNAV iDrive system, we offer remote coding to correct the screen resolution.</p>'

It is advised, though, to use an original Apple cable for better transmission quality.</p>

They recognize your key at a range of up to 5ft, even if it&#39;s in your pocket or bag. This way you&rsquo;ll be able to unlock your car by placing your hand inside the handle, or lock it with a single touch on the handle ridges. The sound signals will let you know when the doors are open or closed.</p>

                                                      <p dir="ltr">The handles feature a chrome trim and are professionally painted in any available BMW color, to perfectly match your vehicle. Please note that the paint on older vehicles may have faded slightly. In this case, the color of the handles may initially differ from your vehicle, but the difference will reduce with time.</p>

                                                      <p dir="ltr">Our Comfort Access allows you to customize the keyless entry process. In the iDrive menu settings you can choose to lock/unlock all doors or only the driver&rsquo;s door on the first touch. In compatible models, the system can also be set to automatically close the windows and sunroof, and fold in the mirrors. In addition, handles for the F10 model can be fitted with LED handle illumination in vehicles with this feature as standard.</p>'
